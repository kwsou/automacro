# Automacro

Automate tedious crafting procedures in FFXIV.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need nodejs.

### Installing

Get package dependencies.

```
npm install
```

### Usage

Now run it as a standalone node app.

```
node app.js
```

You can also pass in a config file instead of passing in the settings manually via the CLI.

```
node app.js --config "./config/default.json"
```

### Potential Todos

This is mostly for my own personal use, but you can use if you have a need for it. Probably will make it a proper desktop app with Electron later or something but for now the bare minimum works on the CLI.
